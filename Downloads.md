The easyest way to test the pyOpTools is to download the pyOpTools-Ubuntu iso. This is an image of an ubuntu Live CD-DVD, that has the pyoptools installed and ready to run. It runs on any PC configured to boot from de CD drive.It has also been tested in a VirtualBox instance.

The primary user defined is **user** and the password is **pyoptools**.

To run the pyOpTools just boot a PC (or virtualbox instance) from the CD, and press the blue icon in the unity bar. This will open an ipython notebook in an internet browser with some python and raytracing samples.
