# pyOpTools #

pyOpTools is a set of packages that allow the simulation of optical systems by raytracing as well as some calculations involving wavefronts, currently under development. It is written in  Python and Cython, and is being developed by the  technological development group of  [CombustiÃ³n Ingenieros S.A.S](http://www.cihologramas.com), and the  [applied optics group](http://www.goaunb.unal.edu.co/) of the  [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://www.unal.edu.co).


The pyOpTools is divided in several packages that contain the different library's functionalities:

  1. [`pyoptools.raytrace`](https://pyoptools.googlecode.com/hg-history/stable/doc/_build/html/api.html#module-pyoptools.raytrace)
> > This package contains the classes and functions used to perform the
> > simulation of optical systems using 3D non-sequential raytracing
> > algorithms.
  1. [`pyoptools.misc`](https://pyoptools.googlecode.com/hg-history/stable/doc/_build/html/api.html#module-pyoptools.misc)
> > This package contains miscellaneous classes and functions used by the
> > other packages, but that can not be classified in any of them.

This package contains the classes and functions used to perform wavefront
propagation simulations.

This software is in a very alpha state, and not ready for production use. Use it at your own risk.
